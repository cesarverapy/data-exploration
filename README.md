# California Housing Prices and Energy Consumption Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that analyze:

1. **California Housing Prices**:
   - Factors influencing high housing prices in California.
   - Exploration of variables like proximity to the ocean, house age, and more.
   - Use of visualization and statistical tools to uncover insights.

2. **Energy Consumption**:
   - Trends and patterns in energy consumption in Brazil.
   - Time-series analysis and cost optimizations for energy usage.

## Insights
- **California Housing**:
  - Houses closer to the ocean tend to have significantly higher prices.
  - Older houses require more analysis on renovation-related costs.

- **Energy Consumption**:
  - Seasonal trends influence energy consumption in Brazil.
  - Opportunities for optimizing energy costs by focusing on low-demand periods.

---

## Future Work
- Extend analysis to include additional datasets (e.g., marginal energy costs in other countries).
- Automate report generation for energy consumption trends.
- Build predictive models for housing prices and energy costs.
